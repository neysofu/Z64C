# Zorro

Zorro is a chess engine written in C99. It is not a complete chess program and requires a UCI-compatible GUI (e.g. XBoard with PolyGlot, Scid, Cute Chess, eboard, Arena, Sigma Chess, etc.) in order to be used comfortably. Read the documentation for your GUI of choice for information about how to use Zorro with it.
