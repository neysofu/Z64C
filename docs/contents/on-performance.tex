\chapter{On performance}

Performance is central to the strenght of chess programs. Other factors being
equal, faster software running faster will be able to search deeper and consider
more lines, which sometimes does win a game. Let's consider the perfect
evaluation function $\delta$ and its approximation $\omega$.

\section{Compiler optimizations and low-level details}

Compiler optimizations play a huge role in the performance of C programs. Z64C
benefits from the following optimizations:

profile guided optimization
% pointer aliasing
% Osize
% -march=native
% -flto
% -frename-registers
% __builtin_prefetch
% hot and cold
